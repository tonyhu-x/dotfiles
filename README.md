# dotfiles

This is my dotfile repository.
This file documents steps that need to be manually executed to finish setup.

## Common

These are programs that consume the managed configs:

- Zsh
- Neovim
- [sioyek](http://sioyek.info)
- VSCode
- latexmk

## macOS

These are macOS apps that consume the managed configs:

* [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org)

## Terminal

Two important things to set up in a new terminal app:

- Disable bell.
- Download a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

## Neovim

I now use [LazyVim](lazyvim.org).
Some external dependencies for it to work well are listed [here](http://www.lazyvim.org).

Some language support requires the corresponding language to be installed.
For example, Typst support needs the Typst compiler.

VimTeX is configured to use sioyek as the PDF viewer.
